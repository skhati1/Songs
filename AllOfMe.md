[Verse 1]
Fm           Db                      Ab
What would I do without your smart mouth
           Eb                      Fm
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
          Db            Ab               Eb          Fm
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
             Db                     Ab
What's going on in that beautiful mind
                Eb             Fm
I'm on your magical mystery ride
        Db                 Ab                     Eb         Bbm
And I'm so   dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus A]
   Bbm             Ab
My head's under water
    Eb              Bbm
But I'm breathing fine
                 Ab              Eb
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
       Ab
Cause all of me
       Fm
Loves all of you
          Bbm
Love your curves and all your edges
           Db           Eb
All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me
             Fm
I'll give my all to you
          Bbm
You're my end and my beginning
     Db                Eb
Even when I lose I'm winning

Cause I give you all, all of me
                  Fm   Db     Ab    Eb
And you give me all, all of you, oh

How many times do I have to tell you

You're my downfall, you're my muse
             Eb                        Fm
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                Db             Ab        Eb            Bbm
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus A]
   Bbm             Ab
My head's under water
    Eb              Bbm
But I'm breathing fine

Cards on the table

Risking it all, though it's hard
