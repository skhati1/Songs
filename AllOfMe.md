<b>Fm  Db  Ab  Eb  x2</b>

[Verse 1]
<b>Fm           Db                      Ab</b>
What would I do without your smart mouth
<b>           Eb                      Fm</b>
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
<b>          Db            Ab               Eb          Fm</b>
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
<b>             Db                     Ab</b>
What's going on in that beautiful mind
<b>                Eb             Fm</b>
I'm on your magical mystery ride
<b>        Db                 Ab                     Eb         Bbm</b>
And I'm so   dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus A]
<b>   Bbm             Ab</b>
My head's under water
<b>    Eb              Bbm</b>
But I'm breathing fine
<b>                 Ab              Eb</b>
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
<b>       Ab</b>
Cause all of me
<b>       Fm</b>
Loves all of you
<b>          Bbm</b>
Love your curves and all your edges
<b>           Db           Eb</b>
All your perfect imperfections
<b>           Ab</b>
Give your all to me
<b>             Fm</b>
I'll give my all to you
<b>          Bbm</b>
You're my end and my beginning
<b>     Db                Eb</b>
Even when I lose I'm winning
<b>                  Fm   Db     Ab    Eb</b>
Cause I give you all, all of me
<b>                  Fm   Db     Ab    Eb</b>
And you give me all, all of you, oh

<b>Fm       Db                       Ab</b>
How many times do I have to tell you
<b>                 Eb                       Fm</b>

<b>              Db           Ab          Eb                  Fm</b>
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
<b>             Db                 Ab</b>
You're my downfall, you're my muse
<b>             Eb                        Fm</b>
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
<b>                Db             Ab        Eb            Bbm</b>
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus A]
<b>   Bbm             Ab</b>
My head's under water
<b>    Eb              Bbm</b>
But I'm breathing fine
<b>                 Ab              Eb</b>
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

And you give me all, all of you, oh

[Pre-Chorus B]
<b>Bbm         Ab</b>
Cards on the table
 <b>      Eb             Bbm</b>
We're both showing hearts
<b>Bbm       Ab                Eb</b>
Risking it all, though it's hard
